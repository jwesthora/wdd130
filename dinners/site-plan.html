        ▢9.6 oz Sausage Crumbles (1 bag)
        ▢2 tbsp minced garlic
        ▢29 oz chicken broth (2 14.5 oz cans)
        ▢20 oz package refrigerated cheese tortellini
        ▢1 1/2 cup water
        ▢14.5 oz diced tomatoes (1 can)
        ▢1 cup fresh baby spinach chopped
        ▢1 tsp dried basil
        ▢1 tsp garlic salt (with parsley flakes)
        ▢pepper
        ▢shredded parmesan cheese
        Instructions
         
        Add sausage crumbles and garlic to a large pot and cook for 1 minute.
        Stir in broth, water and tomatoes and bring to a boil.
        Add tortellini and cook for 6-7 minutes.
        
        Reduce heat to low and add spinach, basil, salt and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes and serve warm with shredded Parmesan cheese on top.
        Notes
        I prefer using the fully cooked Sausage Crumbles (Jimmy Dean makes them, but I’m sure there are other brands) for the sake of time and convenience! If you’d rather use fresh sausage, just cook until no longer pink before adding in the garlic and cooking for 1 minute.
