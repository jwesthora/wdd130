            <p> Ingredients
                <br>1/4 cup flour
               <br> ½ teaspoon black pepper
               <br> ½ teaspoon garlic salt
               <br> ½ teaspoon celery salt
                <br>2 ½ pounds of stew meat, see notes
                <br>3-6 tablespoons olive oil
                <br>3 Tablespoons cold butter, separated
                <br>2 cups yellow onion, diced
                <br>4 cloves garlic, minced
                <br>1 cup high-quality cabernet sauvignon, merlot works as well. See notes.
                <br>4 cups beef broth
                <br>2 tsp better than bouillon, or 2 beef bouillon cubes
                <br>2 Tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce
                <br>3 Tablespoons Tomato Paste
               <br> 5 medium carrots, cut into ¼ inch cubes
                <br>1 lb. baby Yukon gold potatoes, halved or quartered
                <br>2 bay leaves
                <br>1 large branch rosemary
                <br>1 cup frozen peas
                <br>1/4 cup Cold Water + 3 tablespoons Corn Starch, Optional
                <br>2-3 drops Kitchen Bouquet Browning + Seasoning Sauce, (Optional)- Adds an even richer darker color.
                <br>Instructions
                <br>Cut meat into 1-inch cubes, and discard any large pieces of fat. Fat marbleized into the meat is fine!
                <br>Sprinkle beef with black pepper, garlic salt, and celery salt. Toss to coat. Sprinkle flour over the meat and toss again.
                <br>Heat 3 Tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat in batches, don’t overcrowd the pan. Brown on each side for 45 seconds. Add more oil if needed. Transfer to slow cooker.
               <br> Reduce heat to medium and melt 1 Tablespoon butter. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Use a silicone spatula to clean the bottom of the pan, removing any brown remnants. This will give the soup lots of good flavors. If necessary, add a splash of wine to help loosen it. Transfer the onions/garlic mixture to the slow cooker.
                <br>Add all remaining ingredients except for the peas, cornstarch mixture, and 2 tablespoons of cold butter.
                <br>Cook on low for 7 ½ to 8 hours or high for 3½ to 4 hours, until the vegetables, are softened and the potatoes are fork tender.
                <br>Add the peas during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
                <br>Optional: To thicken, combine ¼ cup COLD water with 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch. Slowly add it to the stew, stirring to incorporate. It will continue to thicken upon standing.
                <br>Turn off the heat. Remove the bay leaves and rosemary stem. Swirl in 2 tablespoons of cold butter for a smooth, velvety finish. This is a technique that chefs use called “Monter au Beurre”.
                <br>Optional: Add 3 drops of Kitchen Bouquet for an even darker color.
