        </section>
        <div class="first-goal">We can all relate to the mountain of questions we ask ourselves each morning, some of
            those questions for me reference the end of my day. What am I going to make for dinner?
            Do I have all the ingredients? Will I have time to make dinner? I often reflect on my days as a full-time
            mother of 3 kids, struggling to be a good mother, while still working a job that left me exhausted. Coming
            home to hungry and cranky children stressed me out, then knowing I had to cook something stressed me out
            even more. That is until I started prepping my meals ahead of my weeks with freezer meals. Seeing and
            personally feeling the success of these preperations made me realize how many others I could help,
            therefore, Dinners on a Dime was born.

        </section>
        <div class="second-goal">We believe that dinner time is more than a meal, but moments we are given to connect
            and thrive in our relationships.
            We want you to have more of those moments of connections, by making your meal time less stressful and more
            enjoyable. We hope to bring you peace, comfort, and encouragment that you are doing a good job. We hope to
            aid you in re-discovering the joy of Dinners.

            Our goal for you is to give you the tools you need to feel confident in your ability to prepare, make and
            enjoy dinner time.
