        </section>
        <section>
            <p>We can all relate to the mountain of questions we ask ourselves each morning, some of those questions for me reference the end of my day. What am I going to make for dinner? Do I have all the ingredients? Will I have time to make dinner? I often reflect on my days as a full-time mother of 3 kids, struggling to be a good mother, while still working a job that left me exhausted. Coming home to hungry and cranky children stressed me out, then knowing I had to cook something stressed me out even more. That is until I started prepping my meals ahead of my weeks with freezer meals. Seeing and personally feeling the success of these preperations made me realize how many others I could help, therefore, Dinners on a Dime was born.

We hope to bring you peace, comfort, and encouragment that you are doing a good job. We hope to aid you in re-discovering the joy of Dinners.
