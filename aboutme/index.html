 <h1> About Me</h1>

 <p>My name is Jill Westhora and our family currently lives in Portland Oregon. I have been married to my highschool sweetheart for 17 years and we have 4 children, whose ages range from 16-3. I love all things crafting, projects, home decor, gardening, and turning trash into treasure. We recently had a dinner question that I feel sums up a lot of who I am and what I enjoy. The question was, “if you could choose to be the main character in any tv show or movie, who would it be?”. Both my husband and I said we would want to be the main characters of “Fixer Upper”. 
    My Education is finishing my BS in Interdisciplinary Science and entering the Masters program at George Fox University in conjunction with getting my teaching license. My husband and I would like to teach internationally and allow our family to experience and grasp a deeper love and appreciation for people and cultures around the world.
